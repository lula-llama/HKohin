1)Five topics of interest in computer science include artificial intelligence and robotics,big data analytics, computer assisted education, bioinformatics, and cyber security.

2) I wanted to either do law or computer science.

3)I wanted to do law because I like reading court cases and Iâ€™ve done mock trial before. I wanted to do computer science because I wanted to be a computer hardware engineer and or a video game developer because I admired the skeleton crew from telltale.

4)as a defense attorney you can get anywhere from $45,000-$130,000. Computer hardware engineers can a salary of $115,120. Video game programmer can make $65,911.
